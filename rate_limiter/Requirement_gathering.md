# Rate Limiter Requirements

## Overview
- A rate limiter limits the number of requests or actions within a certain time period to prevent abuse, protect resources, and ensure fair usage.
- It tracks the number of requests made by a client and enforces a predefined limit.
- If the limit is exceeded, the rate limiter can respond with an error or delay the request.
- This prevents system overload, maintains performance, and protects against malicious activities.

## Use Cases
- Limiting API requests per user to prevent abuse and protect server resources.
- Enforcing a maximum number of login attempts per minute to prevent brute-force attacks.
- Restricting file uploads per hour to ensure fair usage of a file-sharing system.
- Controlling the rate of outgoing emails to prevent spamming.
- Limiting database queries per second to maintain performance.

## Functional Requirements
1. Request thresholds based on user identity, IP address, geographic location, user tier, and HTTP request type.
2. Time period for rate limiting (e.g., per second, per minute, per hour, per day).
3. Actions to take when the limit is exceeded (e.g., reject, delay, queue).
4. Exceptions or whitelisting rules for certain requests or IP addresses.
5. Handling steady flow or burst requests.

## Non-Functional Requirements
1. Performance requirements, such as response time and throughput.
2. Security requirements, such as protection against DDoS attacks or abuse.
3. Logging or monitoring requirements for tracking rate limit violations.

## Constraints
1. Technical constraints or limitations to consider during implementation, such as resource overhead and complexity in distributed systems.
2. Integration requirements with existing systems or frameworks.

## Request Handling Options
1. Reject Requests:
  - Description: Deny requests outright and return an error response.
  - Response Code: HTTP 429 Too Many Requests.
  - Use Cases: Systems with strict limits, like public APIs or free-tier services.
  - Pros: Simple to implement, protects system resources effectively.
  - Cons: Might frustrate users if not communicated well.
  - Enhancements: Include a Retry-After header in the response to inform users when they can try again.

2. Delay Requests:
  - Description: Temporarily pause the processing of requests until the rate limit resets.
  - Implementation: Use queues with a delay mechanism, add exponential backoff for retries.
  - Use Cases: Systems where ensuring request processing is critical, like payment gateways.
  - Pros: Improves user experience as requests are not outright rejected.
  - Cons: Adds latency, which might not be acceptable for time-sensitive operations.

3. Queue Requests:
  - Description: Place requests in a queue and process them when the rate limit resets.
  - Implementation: Use a priority queue if some requests need faster handling.
  - Use Cases: Internal systems or APIs with strict SLAs.
  - Pros: Guarantees all requests are eventually processed.
  - Cons: Increased resource usage due to queue management, possible delays for queued requests.

4. Notify and Degrade Gracefully:
  - Description: Provide partial or degraded service instead of rejecting.
  - Use Cases: Applications with tiered features, like lower quality video streaming.
  - Pros: Maintains user satisfaction by offering a fallback.
  - Cons: Involves additional logic for partial service.
