## Core Steps in System Design:

- Requirement gathering: Understand the need, use cases.
- System analysis: Analyze the functional, non-functional requirements and constraints of the system.
- System architecture: Design high-level architecture and define components (e.g., databases, APIs, servers), choose technologies.
- Capacity Planning: Estimate traffic and load, plan for scalability (horizontal/vertical scaling).
- System modeling: Create models and diagrams to visualize the system.

- System implementation: Develop and code the system components.
- System testing: Test the system for functionality, performance, and reliability.
- System deployment: Deploy the system to the production environment.
- System maintenance: Monitor and maintain the system to ensure its smooth operation.
